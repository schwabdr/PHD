name each model appropriately
use model_fns for list of models to pass between funcs

################## INFORMATION ##################
I see now that they define a special forward function for resnet_new.py
They can accept which layer's output they want to return ... and therefore they use this model
as the encoder. This will help me understand the paper a bit better now. The encoder is one of the outer layers
of the resnet model.

These values were used for the adversarial dataset for initial MIAT training.
eps = 8/255.
eps_iter = .007
nb_iter = 40

When testing the loss - I have found that using the STD-ResNet leads to a much higher value for loss_mea_n vs loss_mea_a when attacking MIAT-ResNet


################## CURRENT WORK ##################
1) TRAIN RESNET18 FOR CIFAR 10 - NO AT - DONE
2) Make train_MI_estimator.py more efficient. - DONE
3) See Adversarial Training in "Adversarial Machine Learning at Scale" apply here

************ remove the eval step from the training of the MIAT - don't need it really unless I'm going to plot, and it will speed up training *************
************ optimize the PGD That is don't keep iterating if it's already fooling the target***************
Put a cap on iterations in my "eval_tests_01.py"

################## CONDA ENVIRONMENT ##################
conda env phd04 - here's what I've done - pytorch 1.12 - I hope this keeps working.

conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=10.2 -c pytorch
conda install matplotlib
conda install -c conda-forge torchinfo

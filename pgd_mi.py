'''
This is my attempt to use the MI loss instead of cross-entropy alone to construct adversarial examples.
The 'challenge' is that the MI loss requires multiple more paramaters ... so I'll have to change these functions a bit.
The other challenge is that to compute this loss you require an actual adversarial example. Thus I propose the following.
For now I will use my precomputed adversarial examples. Then I may tune this later on.
It even seems feasible to set X_adv_0 = 1 step of FGSM to start, then use the new loss function
